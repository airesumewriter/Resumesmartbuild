  <h1>Best Resume Formats for 2025</h1>
  <p>Resume trends evolve â€” and in 2025, clarity, minimalism, and mobile-readability lead the pack.</p>
  <p><strong>1. Reverse-Chronological:</strong> Still the gold standard. Lists your most recent roles first, ideal for steady career paths.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Hybrid Format:</strong> Combines a skills summary with chronological roles. Great for career changers or freelancers.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Functional Format:</strong> Focuses on skills over jobs. Best for gaps, but often viewed with caution by recruiters.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Trends in 2025:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mobile-first design: Recruiters may view your resume on a phone.</li>
    <li>No more profile photos: They create bias and clutter.</li>
    <li>Lean formatting: Avoid heavy graphics or colors unless you're in design.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep your format flexible, but always prioritize readability, keyword match, and clean design.</p>
