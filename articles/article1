  <h1>How to Build a Resume That Wins Interviews</h1>
  <p>A powerful resume is more than just a document; it's your personal marketing tool. In today’s competitive job market, standing out is essential.</p>
  <p>Start With a Strong Summary — Your summary is your elevator pitch. It should tell employers who you are, what you specialize in, and what makes you different.</p>
  <p>Use Action-Oriented Language — Use verbs like 'Led', 'Managed', 'Designed', and 'Improved'. Employers want to see what you did and the impact you made.</p>
  <p>Tailor for Every Application — Don’t use one resume for all jobs. Customize it by using keywords from each job posting. This boosts relevance and makes you stand out in both ATS and human review.</p>
  <p>Focus on Achievements — Instead of listing duties, highlight specific accomplishments using numbers and outcomes where possible. “Managed a team of 6” sounds better than “Responsible for team”.</p>
  <p>Keep It Clean and Readable — Use clear fonts, bullet points, and consistent formatting. Avoid overly complex templates that can confuse ATS systems.</p>
  <p>Use standard headings like "Work Experience" and "Education" — this helps ATS scan and categorize your content properly.</p>
  <p>Avoid: Photos, graphics, or charts. These often break ATS parsing and might make your resume unreadable to software.</p>
  <p>File Format: Always save as .docx or .pdf unless the job description specifies otherwise. Double check that formatting is preserved.</p>
  <p>Conclusion: Your resume is your first impression — make it count. With the right strategy, format, and focus, you’ll increase your chances of landing interviews fast.</p>
