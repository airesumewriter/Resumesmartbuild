  <h1>Why Tailoring Your Resume Matters</h1>
  <p>Sending the same resume to every job? You’re missing out. Tailoring your resume can dramatically improve your response rate.</p>
  <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Recruiters want to see how you match their role — not just your general experience.</p>
  <p><strong>What to Tailor:</strong> Summary, core skills, and experience bullets. Pull language directly from the job description.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the job calls for “data visualization”, make sure that phrase appears in your resume — especially in your project experience.</p>
  <p><strong>Time-Saver Tip:</strong> Use a base resume template, then duplicate and tweak it for each job. 5–10 minutes of tailoring can make a huge difference.</p>
  <p>Tailoring = higher ATS match + better recruiter engagement. It’s a small effort with a big return.</p>
