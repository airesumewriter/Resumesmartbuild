        <h2>Smarter Screening with AI</h2>
        <p>In 2025, resumes will be screened by more advanced AI than ever. Keywords, formatting, and personalization are critical to passing automated filters.</p>

        <h2>Human-AI Hybrid Review</h2>
        <p>While AI handles initial sorting, human recruiters still weigh in—especially on resumes that show strategy and story. Use AI tools to enhance, not replace, your voice.</p>

        <h2>Data-Driven Resume Building</h2>
        <p>Tools like ResumeSmartBuild use machine learning to recommend bullet points, job-specific wording, and formatting based on recruiter behavior data.</p>
